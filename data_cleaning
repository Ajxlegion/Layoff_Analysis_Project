USE LAYOFF;
SELECT *

-- first thing we want to do is create a staging table. This is the one we will work in and clean the data. We want a table with the raw data in case something happens

CREATE TABLE LAYOFF_STAGING
LIKE LAYOFFS;

INSERT LAYOFF_STAGING 
select *
FROM layoffS;

-- now when we are data cleaning we usually follow a few steps
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values and see what 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary
